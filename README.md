# NoElytra
A Minecraft plugin that makes elytra more balanced by "closing" them in dimensions outside of the end.

When a player exits the end with a pair of open elytra, the elytra get replaced with a leather chestplate named "Closed Elytra".
When a player enters the end, the leather chestplate opens up to become a pair of elytra again.
This process preserves durability, enchantments, and custom names
